Steam Friends Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whats this good for? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You're on a OS that Steam doesn't officially support,
or you don't want to/can't install Steam on the machine you're working on. 
Steam Friends Status will let you know what your friends are up to without 
having to keep a browser window open -- it'll also tell you server 
information to let you know if there is space to join your friend.

System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python is needed to run the basic command-line version: cli/steamfriends2.py
PyQT4 is required for the GUI version of Steam Friends Status: steamfriends
lxml.html (http://codespeak.net/lxml/index.html#download) is required for 
HTML parsing (applies to both the command-line version, and the PyQT4 version).

Running Steam Friends Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the GUI version, execute steamfriends in the root folder.
To run the command-line version, execute steamfriends2.py under the cli/ folder.

Steam Identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your steam identity is two things, both of which can be found in the steamcommunity.com URL. Enter either the short name or ID number into what $n is (it is either a number, or a name).

Short Name: http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/$n
ID Number: http://www.steamcommunity.com/profiles/$n
Full URL: You can now provide the full Steam Community URL as well!
Paste the address of the profile you want to show up in Steam Friends 
Status into the Steam Identity box.

Server information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Friends that are in-game and on a server accessible through the Internet
can now have their server's statistics displayed through Steam Friends Status.

Double-clicking on the Server: entry under the friend entry shows more 
information.
